Fork of ``astrodendro`` [https://dendrograms.readthedocs.io/](https://dendrograms.readthedocs.io/) replacing the built-in bad progressbar with tqdm.
The original progress bar spams stdout with way too many lines which crashes jupyter notebooks. tqdm runs just fine in jupyter and also offers a guesstimated run time.
